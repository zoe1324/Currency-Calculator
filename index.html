<!--
Conversions should be from "visiting" to "home" to give
them an idea how much it will end up costing in their
normal currency once it comes off their card account.

SAMPLE SCENARIO:
Sam, who lives in Scotland, is visiting friends in
Lithuania. She wants to give them a celebratory bottle
of nice champagne. In a local wine shop there is a bottle
for €80. Sam has preset the app to have GBP as her home
currency and EUR as the visiting currency and knows her
card charges 2%. She taps 80= on the calculator like pad
and sees £72 (calculated as approx £71 for wine plus about
£1 in fees).

STAGE 1:
A basic fixed exchange rate calculator (max 18/40)
This calculator should use standard HTML controls
(minimal layout styling only) and hard coded exchange
rates. Allows selection of home and destination currency
but defaults to home=GBP and visiting=EUR on each run.
Supports calculator style pad (of normal web-like buttons)
and a two line "display". Uses large text for all
displays but can use basic HTML5 controls for everything.
Should support Euro, Polish zloty and UK Pound but rates
can be fixed (stored in code). No need for bank charge.
